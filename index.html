            <p>You probably didn't ask, but if there is one thing I like, it is film. Film is the culmination of written text, spoken word, music, acting, and moving photography all combined into one medium. It is also the only artistic medium (besides maybe video games) that requires many peoples' artistic visions to come together as often hundreds of people will be working together on larger films. However, film is still primarily a visual medium. A good director knows that one good image is filled in with meaning by the human mind. As an example, I present this still from the movie Gravity (it's not the deepest movie, but the director knows what he's doing):</p>
